# Single Cell Atlas Ontology

The Single Cell Atlas Ontology (SCAO) provides a systematic description of many experimental variables available in single cell atlas databases (Expression Atlas (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa)), and for projects datas such data sets from ArrayExpress , NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) as well as other sources. Increasingly, mass spectrometry proteomics data coming from the PRoteomics IDEntification (PRIDE) database are included. It combines parts of several biological ontologies, such as UBERON anatomy, ChEBI chemical compounds, Cell Ontology, NCBITaxon, NCIT, BTO, FBDV, RS, WBLS ,PECO (EO), EFO, Orphanet, PATO, PO, GO, and others. The scope of SCAO is to support the annotation, analysis and visualization of data handled by the Exprsssion Atlas group  at the EBI and as the core ontology for Single Cell Atlas project (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/home). SCAO  is developed by the EMBL-EBI Samples, Phenotypes and Ontologies Team (SPOT). We for the maintainance of the ontology.
